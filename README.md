## :de: whoami 

My name is Tim Halach.

I am from Germany, am currently enrolled at the University of Stuttgart and am doing my Bachelors degree in Medieninformatik (computer science with a focus on human-computer-interaction).


## :fallen_leaf: My Interests

I am still looking for specifics so for now it is only: anything grafics related.
Apart from what I am interested in actually programming I like to learn about how computers work on a low level.

Also nature is awesome.

I may or may not have yet to work on my online presence.
